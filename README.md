# detect-template-region
Detects the head and back (tail) most problable "template region" of a sample of HTML pages or XML contents.

This project only shows an alternative algorithm for **check the reliability** of "Boilerplate Removal" based on [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) and precise [XPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath) selection.

The algorithm is valid to evaluate any XML or web page *corpus* (see [samples](originalContent)), aiming "100% template removal".
